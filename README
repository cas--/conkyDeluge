PREREQUISITES
=============

It is expected that the user is already familiar with Conky.

Any conky specific help can be found by either visiting the conky website here:

    http://conky.sourceforge.net

Alternatively there is a large user base, various helpful posts are available
at http://www.ubuntuforums.org

For example, to see various incarnations of conky setups, or to ask technical
questions you could go here:

EXAMPLE USE
===========

In the /usr/share/conkydeluge/example folder you'll find 2 files, conkyrc and
conkyDeluge.template

Conky can be run using these example files as follows:

    conky -c /usr/share/conkydeluge/example/conkyrc &
    
Make sure Deluge is running first...

                        [totaldone], [totalsize], [progress], [nofiles],
                        [downloadrate], [uploadrate], [eta], [currentpeers],

                        note that a torrent's state supersedes anything else
                        for sorting, in the order, from top to bottom:
                        downloading, seeding, queued, paused, unknown)
  -v, --verbose         Request verbose output, no a good idea when running
                        through conky!
  -V, --version         Displays the version of the script.
  --errorlogfile=FILE   If a filepath is set, the script appends errors to the
                        filepath.
  --infologfile=FILE    If a filepath is set, the script appends info to the
                        filepath.


TEMPLATE FILES
==============

A template file is included in the example files and there are also details on
the template option in the command options listed above.

Note that you can combine standard font output with other fonts in a single
template, but must use execp or execpi conky commands to do so.

Please take a look at the example template provided. You will see that it uses
text inside a "<" and a ">" as markers, these must be exact for the replacment
event text to be output. Anything outside of these markers will be output as
it looks in the template.


FURTHER HELP
============

If you have an issue and are not sure, try running the same command in the
terminal window and add the option --verbose, you should then see lots of
information about what the script is doing, any warnings or errors should also
be displayed.

If after doing the above you are still stuck, further help can be found by 
visiting this thread on ubuntuforums.org:

	Conky Deluge Python Script
	
	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=5958806

Note that it is best to post --verbose output of your script call, as well as
the conkyrc you are using. This way the issue can be understood quickly and
easily.

ENJOY :)
